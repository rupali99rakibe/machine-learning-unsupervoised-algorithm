Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Recommendation Systems
Welcome to the Unsupervised Learning repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including clustering and recommendation systems, in Python.

Overview
Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that deals with finding hidden patterns or structures in data without explicit supervision. This repository covers two key areas of unsupervised learning: clustering and recommendation systems. Whether you're new to unsupervised learning or looking to explore specific algorithms, you'll find everything you need to build and evaluate models here.

Contents
1. Clustering Algorithms
Introduction to clustering: concept, applications, and evaluation metrics.
Implementation of popular clustering algorithms:
K-means clustering
Hierarchical clustering
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
Techniques for determining the optimal number of clusters.
2. Recommendation Systems
Introduction to recommendation systems: types (content-based, collaborative filtering) and applications.
Implementation of recommendation systems using:
Content-based filtering
Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based)
Evaluation metrics for recommendation systems: precision, recall, F1-score, and others.
3. Case Studies
Practical examples and case studies demonstrating the implementation of clustering and recommendation systems for real-world datasets.
Datasets and analysis techniques to reinforce learning.
